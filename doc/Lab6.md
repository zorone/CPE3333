>   - It'll set `Turn Around time` as the `bursting time` (In this case, `Turn Around time` is the same as the length of `bursting time`, as there aren't any process beforehand, and the process doesn't have to wait any.)

>   - `starting time` of the next process, is the same as the `finishing time` of the last process.
>   - `waiting time` is the length from `arriving time` to `starting time`
>   - `finishing time` is the point after `starting time`, with the length of `bursting time`
>   - `Turn Around time`, in this code, is the time from `arriving time` to `finishing time`. which is the same length as the time from `arriving time`, to `waiting time`, and then to `bursting time`
